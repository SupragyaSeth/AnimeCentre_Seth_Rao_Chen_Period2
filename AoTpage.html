            Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by giants. Giants are typically several stories tall,
            seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source.
            A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the
            biggest of giants. Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a giant in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster
            sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a super giant that appears out of thin air. As the 
            smaller giants flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every 
            single giant and take revenge for all of mankind.
