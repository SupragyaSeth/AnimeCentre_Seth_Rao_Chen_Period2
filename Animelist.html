                      Summary: Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by giants. Giants are typically several stories tall,
                      seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source.
                      A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the
                      biggest of giants. Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a giant in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster
                      sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a super giant that appears out of thin air. As the 
                      smaller giants flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every 
                      single giant and take revenge for all of mankind.

                  “Quirks” at age four? Heroes and villains would be battling it out everywhere! Becoming a hero would mean learning

                  were one of the 20 percent who were born Quirkless? Middle school student Izuku Midoriya wants to be a hero more than
                  anything, but he hasn't got an ounce of power in him. With no chance of ever getting into the prestigious U.A. High School

                    pointlessly, it's clearly a bad choice. The goddess who greets him in the afterlife, however, offers him
                    a chance to be reborn in a world not unlike that of a video game, and as a bonus she'll even throw in a cool
                    item or power! Can't possibly be a bad choice, right? Except he arrives with no money at all, dead average skills, 
                    and his "bonus" isn't useful at all--since he picked the goddess, Aqua, herself. How are the two of them supposed 
                    to defeat the evil Devil King and live happily ever after? Well, for them, it probably starts with day laboring 
                    rather than adventuring. And it's only going to get more disappointing from there!
